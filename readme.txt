= Why does the button not shown how long it has been since it was last clicked? =

The relevant option must be checked in the widget administration (the checkbox "Show time since last button click?" must be checked).

The "Text when showing time" field must also contain the string %TIME% somewhere (for example: "It's been %TIME% since the button was last clicked").
